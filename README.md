# Traffic-Sign-Recognition-using-CNN

This project was done as part of the *Artificial Intelligence* course at Faculty of Electrical Engineering, University of Sarajevo, Department of Computer Science and Informatics.

## Project Overview

This project focuses on the development of a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)-based system for **automatic recognition and classification of traffic signs** using images. The goal is to contribute to help identify important traffic information contained in traffic signs.

The application enables users to upload a traffic sign image, which is then classified by a trained model. A **web-based interface** was built using [Anvil](https://anvil.works/) for ease of use and demonstration.

**Demo app is available here**:

## Key Features

- **CNN-based classifier** trained on 51,839 traffic sign images across 43 classes.
- **Achieved 97.62% accuracy** on the official test dataset.
- Real-time prediction using a simple **web UI** powered by Anvil.
- Full training pipeline built in **Google Colab** using TensorFlow/Keras.
- Evaluation metrics include precision, recall, F1-score, and confusion matrix.
- **Interactive application** with image upload and visual feedback for predictions.

## Dataset

- **Name**: Traffic Signs Preprocessed  
- **Source**: [Kaggle Dataset by Valentyn Sichkar](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/valentynsichkar/traffic-signs-preprocessed)  
- **Size**: 51,839 images  
- **Format**: 32x32 RGB images  
- **Classes**: 43 traffic sign categories  
- **Split**: Train / Validation / Test  
- **Preprocessing**: Normalization, one-hot encoding, RGB channels preserved.

## Technologies Used

- **Language**: Python 3  
- **Libraries**: TensorFlow, Keras, NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, Pickle  
- **Interface**: Anvil (Frontend), Google Colab (Backend)

## Model Training & Evaluation

- Model architecture:  
  - 3 Convolutional layers with ReLU + BatchNorm + MaxPooling  
  - GlobalAveragePooling  
  - Dense(128) + Dropout(0.6)  
  - Output layer: `softmax` with 43 neurons (one per class)

- Loss function: `categorical_crossentropy`  
- Optimizer: `Adam`, learning rate: `1e-4`  
- Epochs: 80  
- Early stopping and learning rate reduction applied  
- **Test Accuracy**: 97.62%  
- **Loss**: 0.1619

> Additional evaluation on real-world traffic signs from the internet showed that the model performs well but struggles in cases with unseen variations (e.g., lighting, blur). This demonstrates a need for further robustness through **data augmentation**.

## Application Flow

1. **Upload** a traffic sign image via the Anvil UI.
2. The image is sent to the server (Google Colab) where:
   - The image is preprocessed (resized, normalized).
   - It is passed through the trained CNN model.
   - The class is predicted with a confidence score.
3. **Result** is displayed in the UI with the predicted sign meaning.

## Results Summary

- Very high training and validation accuracy without signs of overfitting.
- Model generalizes well on test data.
- Lower performance on underrepresented classes such as:
  - Class 21: Double curve
  - Class 27: Pedestrians
  - Class 30: Beware of ice/snow

> **Future improvements**:
- Add **data augmentation** (rotation, zoom, brightness).
- Explore **alternative architectures** (e.g., MobileNet, ResNet).
- Collect more real-world data for improved generalization.
- Implement **error analysis** and **class balancing**.
